        <h2>Education Requirements</h2>
        <p>To be a computer programmer of any kind you would typically need at least a Bachelor’s in Computer science and technology, but some organizations may hire programmers with an associates degree or a degree in a related field, such as mathematics. The ability to do higher math is also integral to programming and would be incredibly difficult without. Many programmers also specialize in a few programming languages and are adept in their specific field.</p>

        <h2>Skill Requirements</h2>
        <p>The most prominent skill necessary for computer programming is mathematics, but computer programming also requires an attention to detail, problem solving, the ability to analyze data and above all, good communication skills. Specifically with game design, it is much more than programming and would excercise creative muscles, such as visual art, sound and writing, but some of those skills are used in coding regardless of if you were designing a game or a website for a client.</p>
