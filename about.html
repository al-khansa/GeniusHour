        <h2>Interview</h2>
        <p>I was very fortunate to be able to talk to Ms. Kidwell about her work as a computer programmer. What follows are her answers to the questions I asked about her career.</p>

        <h4>How did you become interested in programming? At what age?</h4>
        <p>My introduction to programming was pretty rudimentary. Initially, I started with simple HTML and CSS to modify web pages somewhere around twelve years old because I didn’t like the standard layout and design of certain websites that allowed you to modify the user experience (Geocities, Tumblr, Myspace). I would liken this to younger generations getting involved in Scratch. In my early career, I also learned basic SQL to help with understanding Excel data at the companies I worked for. SQL is a really efficient way to query masses of data in spreadsheets, which is typically hard to do if a database isn’t set up.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h4>I would like to do freelance programming and possibly make money off of my own projects. How reasonable are my goals?</h4>
        <p>It depends on the type of programming you want to pursue. As a fundamental recommendation, I would suggest starting with GitHub and making public any code repositories are willing to share. GitHub offers sponsorship of your code from adopters but that’s not guaranteed income.</p>
        <p>To supplement this effort, I would also suggest sites like Flippa for sales of sites you’ve created (if your experience is web development). As a career, there are many creative agencies that hire developers to translate their ideas from sketches to code, so those are also good options to pursue. However, I would advise that, as a 7th grader, the pace of technology will advance really quickly by the time you’re ready for post-academic employment - so it’s more important that you learn how to learn than dig into a single domain area of skill set.</p>

        <h4>What challenges might I face being female in this field?</h4>
        <p>My hope would be that once you enter your career this will no longer be a concern. That said, if gender inequality remains, I would suggest a few things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Familiarize yourself on the topic of intersectionality as it may present you with the reality that you’re less alone in this industry than you feel; also, this may highlight the need for empathy and action beyond your self-identified group.</li>
          <li>Learn to advocate for yourself, which necessitates understanding the need to find allies and learning to manage conflict - both of which are useful beyond conditions of gender disparity</li>
          <li>Join other under-represented groups in the industry to ensure a sense of community and to leverage as support if/when you may need it: Women in tech, Girls who code, so on…</li>
          <li>Learn resilience - it is my hope that you won’t find the need to do this in the future but the fact of the matter is, nowadays, the burden of fixing discrimination in the tech industry is left to those suffering from its effects; so focus on being an engineer where you can and push on your boss to fix systemic problems that may hinder the success of underrepresented groups; this also necessitates you find a reputable leader that shares your same values about workplace equity.</li>
