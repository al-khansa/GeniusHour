        <h2>Interview</h2>
        <p>I was very fortunate to be able to talk to Ms. Kidwell about her work as a computer programmer. What follows are her answers to the questions I asked about her career.</p>

        <h4>How did you become interested in programming? At what age?</h4>
        <p>My introduction to programming was pretty rudimentary. Initially, I started with simple HTML and CSS to modify web pages somewhere around twelve years old because I didn’t like the standard layout and design of certain websites that allowed you to modify the user experience (Geocities, Tumblr, Myspace). I would liken this to younger generations getting involved in Scratch. In my early career, I also learned basic SQL to help with understanding Excel data at the companies I worked for. SQL is a really efficient way to query masses of data in spreadsheets, which is typically hard to do if a database isn’t set up.</p>

        <h4>I would like to do freelance programming and possibly make money off of my own projects. How reasonable are my goals?</h4>
        <p>It depends on the type of programming you want to pursue. As a fundamental recommendation, I would suggest starting with GitHub and making public any code repositories are willing to share. GitHub offers sponsorship of your code from adopters but that’s not guaranteed income.</p>
        <p>To supplement this effort, I would also suggest sites like Flippa for sales of sites you’ve created (if your experience is web development). As a career, there are many creative agencies that hire developers to translate their ideas from sketches to code, so those are also good options to pursue. However, I would advise that, as a 7th grader, the pace of technology will advance really quickly by the time you’re ready for post-academic employment - so it’s more important that you learn how to learn than dig into a single domain area of skill set.</p>

        <h4>What challenges might I face being female in this field?</h4>
        <p>My hope would be that once you enter your career this will no longer be a concern. That said, if gender inequality remains, I would suggest a few things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Familiarize yourself on the topic of intersectionality as it may present you with the reality that you’re less alone in this industry than you feel; also, this may highlight the need for empathy and action beyond your self-identified group.</li>
          <li>Learn to advocate for yourself, which necessitates understanding the need to find allies and learning to manage conflict - both of which are useful beyond conditions of gender disparity</li>
          <li>Join other under-represented groups in the industry to ensure a sense of community and to leverage as support if/when you may need it: Women in tech, Girls who code, so on…</li>
          <li>Learn resilience - it is my hope that you won’t find the need to do this in the future but the fact of the matter is, nowadays, the burden of fixing discrimination in the tech industry is left to those suffering from its effects; so focus on being an engineer where you can and push on your boss to fix systemic problems that may hinder the success of underrepresented groups; this also necessitates you find a reputable leader that shares your same values about workplace equity.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Which programming paradigms do you work with, and which do you prefer? Currently I am learning object oriented programming.</h4>
        <p>There are a few paradigms I subscribe to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object Oriented Programming - as you’re aware of and learning</li>
          <li>Immutable Infrastructure - every change in code should result in a new build</li>
          <li>Test Driven development - scoping known test cases as software is being written</li>
          <li>Pair Programming - collaboration and resilience are key; you’ll often hear of the “lottery factor”; as in - if this subject matter expert won the lottery and decided never to come back to work - how would we handle the situation?</li>
          <li>Full Stack Development - it’s advisable to understand the front end (client), back end (server), and database encompassing the system and the technologies involved</li>
          <li>Accessibility - anything you develop that’s consumer facing should adhere to accessibility needs (video, closed captions, voice, language translation, so on…)</li>
          <li>Experimentation - being able to rapidly prototype and ship changes to your customer; this feedback loop informs your engineering roadmap</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Do you prefer to work in groups or on your own? Why?</h4>
        <p>Personally, I am an avid introvert. My preference is to formulate my thoughts and intentions before sharing them with a larger audience. I ruminate over things, not so long as it prohibits input, so I remain aware that “done is better than perfect” and tend to share my thoughts with the group early and often with the premise that thy may not be foolproof but require input, I’ve found the ability to do this successfully is dependent on the psychological safety of the group, which is probably not too different from what you experience in group projects at school.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I’ve found that engineering skills are often needed on demand. As a result, I’ve learned to explain complex topics to a non-technical audience using analogies and metaphors that are easier to translate to my counterparts in groups. Luckily, I supplemented this skill inadvertently by reading fiction and fantasy to translate computer science topics into relatable stories.</p>

        <h4>Do you have time for hobbies and your work?</h4>
        <p>Regardless of the profession you enter — time management is a struggle; in your case, made more complicated by the fast changing pace of technology. Instead of trying to keep up with every new technology fad, I’ve found ways to separate my personal interests from my work responsibilities. For example, I teach yoga through the Art of Yoga program and am part of a sewing group in my local community. This gives me a welcome separation of work/life balance that I strongly recommend establishing early and reinforcing often.</p>

        <h4>Do you play video games? Were you interested in them as a kid? If so, which ones? </h4>
        <p>Surprisingly, I never played video games beyond the first or second attempt! However, I did play many board games, which seems similar in concept.</p>

        <h4>What was your first computer? </h4>
        <p>A Commodore 64! It was huge and took up the entire surface area of our kitchen table. When I was in trouble as a kid, my Mom would take it apart and my punishment was to assemble it for use. Eventually, I was able to do this very quickly (translates to how often I was in trouble!) So the punishment became how to perform “garbage collection” on the machine - mind you - this was before cloud computing, so the limitations of what could be rendered or stored was limited to what the machine specified.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h4>What do you think will change your field in the future? </h4>
        <p>In the future, I anticipate programming will become a more rote process handled by machine learning and artificial intelligence. That said, engineers will be instrumental in building the models for these processes to function effectively. Look at ChatGBT as an example from OpenAI - phenomenal technology but harmful if the responses are not validated by ethics and accuracy.</p>
