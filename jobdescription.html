        <h2>General Description of Solo Game Development</h2>
        <p>(Solo) Game programming would entail lots of different areas of programming, including different languages and functions, but also writing and creating artand other visuals to be used in the game. There could also be some level of advertising and marketing involved but I could hire an outside firm to do this for me as my passion is not making ads.</p>

        <h2>Benefits & Drawbacks</h2>
        <p>I find that being able to work for my own projects and being self managing are huge benefits, along with the fact that game programming handles many different skillsets and combines many things I love. There is a culture of overworking surrounding game development though, and it would have to be done between doing other jobs to support myself (until I can be supported by my games).</p>

        <h2>Duties</h2>
        <p>The work is done inside, at a desk, at a computer and (probably) at home at my own desk. Obviously, it’s practically a virtual job and could be done in any city. There’s no “required amount of hours” for work, but honestly many indie developers end up working 8-14 hours per day, but there’s no ‘standard’ in indie development.</p>

        <h2>Typical Day</h2>
        <p>Most game developers follow a schedule of their day and have what they want to accomplish written down, usually ranging from things like problem solving and bug fixing to pixel art and design of course aside from developing new portions of the game, usually sectioned off into things like “working on cycles”, “adding [x]”, etc.</p>
